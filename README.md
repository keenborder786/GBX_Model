# GBX_Model

## Instruction
<p1> There are four notebooks in the main folder-Each notebook is made to be run as it is. Each notebook represent the test of GBX Model on the respective dataset </p1>
<ul>
  <li> GBX model on WSDM Challenge.ipynb</li>
  <li>FNC-ARC Data GBX model.ipynb</li>
  <li>GBX model on Fakeddit.ipynb</li>
  <li> Liar Dataset GBX Model.ipynb</li>
</ul>

<p2> However, in order to run GBX we need to have access to TPU therefore it is recommended to run each of the notebook on google colab </p2>

<h1> How to run on google colab </h1>
<p3>Open Github notebook whatever you want to work in Google Colab. Change the domain from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com'. The notebook will open in Colab.</p3>
